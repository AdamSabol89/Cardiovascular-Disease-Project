# Cardiovascular Disease Death Estimation: Project Overview
- Utilized various linear models to estimate the effects that mean_bmi or %obesity have on cardiovascular disease deaths with best model test RMSE of 22.71.
- Data was sourced from ourworldindata.org, cleaning was done to form one final dataset including cardiovascular disease deaths, mean_bmi, and gdp_per_capita. 
- Exploratory analysis and modeling notebooks were published on RPubs. 
- Utilized fixed and random effects models to estimate cardiovascular deaths.
